# This is a Hybrid Hotel Recommendation System with Integrated Weather and Location API

This project uses two main models for making recommendations: Collaborative filtering model and a Content-based filtering model. 
It utilises machine learning algorithims such as K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) and K-means clustering algorithims to 
personalize hotel recommendations based on user preferences and historical data. Once it gets the necessary recommendations. 
it filters based on location so as to give you recommendations for where you are going. 
It also shows the location on a map, fetches the hotel data from google to make booking easier and gives weather information about the area you are visiting.
